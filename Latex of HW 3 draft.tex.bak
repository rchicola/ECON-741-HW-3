\section{Question 1:  Polynomials (Stata)}
Let’s see how income varies with age. First construct your sample. We will want to
study individuals who are (inclusively) between 16 and 65 years of age, have positive earnings, and worked more than 1000 hours in a year. Pick a polynomial specification (of age) to run.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item Present the results from your regression.  (5 points)

Answer:\\
%For some reason Table 1: Poly Regr Outputs at bottom of page. Can't figure out how to get it under part A

\begin{table}[tbp] \centering
\newcolumntype{C}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}X}

\end{table}


\item Explain why you picked the specification you did.  (6 points)

Looking at the twoway scatter (age incwage), it appeared visually that there might be a cubic. Also looking at the Adjusted R sqr increasing when adding polynomial terms and we check to see if adding polynomial terms adds anything to the regression when looking at the coefficients. Finally, ovtest was used to check if we were had omitted any polynomials.

Our specification:\\
reg incwage age age2 age3 age4 age5

%insert twoway scatter

%Still shows in the wrong spot

\item  Give the marginal effect and the average of the marginal effects.  (4 points)

We used the margins, dydx and atmeans commands

Average Marginal Effects 
margins, dydx(age age2 age3 age4 age5)

Marginal effects at the means
margins, dydx(age age2 age3 age4 age5) atmeans




\item  Discuss the significance of your polynomial overall as well as the individual terms.  (4 points)

\end{enumerate}

\section{Question 2:  Indicator Variables and Interactions  (Stata)}
Let’s now see how earnings varies with marriage. Use the marst variable to create
three indicator variables for whether people are a) never married b) currently married c) formerly married.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item  Put all three indicator variables into your model. Discuss the results. (6 points)

\item Run a model that will test whether or not married people see their wages go up
more quickly with age than people who were never married. Discuss the results.
(8 points)

\end{enumerate}

\section{Question 3:  Functional Form (Stata)}
Construct a variable that is years of education. Report and interpret (in one sentence each) the following coefficients with a model of earnings on education:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]

\item Linear-Linear (4 points)
\item Log-Linear (4 points)
\item Linear-Log (4 points)
\item Log-Log (4 points)

\end{enumerate}

\section{Question 4:  Heteroskedasticity (Stata and R)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]

\item Is there evidence of heteroskedasticity based on age? Show me in a picture.
Discuss. (12 points)\\

Yes.  If there were no heteroskedasticity in the data the residuals plotted agains the independent variable would be random.  In the figure below we see that there is an upward curve in the data.  It is certainly not random.  Therefore the data shows clear heteroskedasticity.

\item Obtain robust standard errors in R and Stata. (18 points)

The values of the robust standard errors found in R were as follows:\\
With no adjustment for degrees of freedom:

Age:  23.6251\\
Age2:  0.3024647\\
Cons:  399.5719148\\

We adjusted these values for the degrees of freedom using:

$ N/(N-k)$

Age:  23.625128\\
Age2:  0.302465 \\
Cons:  399.572365\\

Using Stata we found the following values for robust standard errors:

Age:  23.62513\\
Age2:  0.302465 \\
Cons:  399.5724\\

\end{enumerate}
